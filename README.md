# Library

### About
This is the [library project](https://www.theodinproject.com/courses/javascript/lessons/library) from the JavaScript section of [The Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com). It's a small web app that allows you to add and remove books from a 'library'. 

The application uses Google Cloud's Firestore NoSQL database to persist any changes to the library.

This project was initially a practice in the use of object constructors and prototypes, and later became a practice in using asynchonous JavaScript with Google Cloud's Firestore NoSQL database.
