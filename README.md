# Library

### About
This is the [library project](https://www.theodinproject.com/courses/javascript/lessons/library) from the JavaScript section of [The Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com). It's a small web app that allows you to add and remove books from a 'library'. 

Changes to library do not persist (*yet*).

This project is a practice in the use of object constructors and their prototypes.
